{"version": "1.1.0", "data": "Many firefighters will by now be exhausted, having been on the front line of Australia\u2019s bushfire crisis for weeks or months. \n\nThis bushfire season has been unrelenting, and the hottest months of summer may still lie ahead.\n\nIn part, the toll is physical. The flames are high, they are intense, and they move fast. It\u2019s hard to breathe because the air is so hot. \n\nAt the same time, first responders have witnessed widespread devastation. To land and livelihoods, to people and animals. Meanwhile, grief for the death of fellow firefighters feels raw, and the risk to their own lives very real.\n\nWe\u2019re right to be concerned about firefighters\u2019 mental health.\n\nRead more: 'I can still picture the faces': Black Saturday firefighters want you to listen to them, not call them 'heroes'\n\n## Emergency responders already have poorer mental health\n\nEvery 4.3 weeks, a firefighter, paramedic or police officer dies by suicide \u2013 and that\u2019s when it\u2019s \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \n\nResearch shows our first responders are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health condition than the overall Australian population. They are more than twice as likely to think about suicide, and three times as likely to have a suicide plan. \n\nThis paints a grim picture of the well-being of a population who dedicate their professional lives to helping others.\n\nRead more: As bushfires intensify, we need to acknowledge the strain on our volunteers\n\nIt\u2019s likely responding to a disaster on the scale of the current bushfires could increase the risk of mental illness for some.\n\nIf firefighters are not coping, they may develop psychological disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.\n\n## PTSD\n\nPTSD develops when a person isn\u2019t able to recover after experiencing a traumatic event.\n\nSome firefighters may develop symptoms while they\u2019re still fighting the fires. They may feel on edge, but push down their fears to get on with the job. However, it\u2019s more likely symptoms will only appear weeks, months, even years down the track.\n\nPTSD is associated with significant impairment in day-to-day functioning socially and at work. For firefighters and others with PTSD, typical symptoms or behaviours will include:\n\n  * reliving the traumatic event. People with PTSD describe vivid images and terrifying nightmares of their experience\n\n  * avoiding reminders of what happened. They may become emotionally numb and isolate themselves to avoid any triggers\n\n  * being constantly tense and jumpy, always looking out for signs of danger.\n\n\nExhaustion is likely compounding the mental strain on firefighters. David Mariuz/AAP\n\nVolunteers in regional communities are particularly susceptible to trauma. They have often joined fire brigades to help protect their own communities, and then face trying to save their own homes or those of neighbours and friends.\n\nWe also need to be mindful of retired firefighters for whom these current bushfires will have triggered painful and disturbing memories. They may not currently be on the front lines, but they only need to turn on the television, open the newspaper, or look at social media to be taken straight back to Black Saturday or whatever particular event is distressing for them. \n\nRead more: Paramedics need more support to deal with daily trauma\n\n## The problem with reaching out\n\nThe increased prevalence of mental health issues among emergency responders suggests many existing emergency service well-being programs are failing those who need them the most. \n\nIn Australia, these programs are largely based on a what\u2019s called a \u201cresilience model\u201d that focuses on people \u201creaching out\u201d and seeking help when they need it. \n\nFirst responders may be unlikely to take this initiative in the middle of a mental health crisis, when it\u2019s often a struggle even to pick up the phone to a loved one, friend or colleague.\n\nSome firefighters might not reach out for help when they need it. Jacob Carracher, Author provided\n\nInstead, we need an approach to well-being that removes the onus on the individual. We need to shift our thinking from a model that requires the individual to \u201creach out\u201d, to a model that also values others \u201creaching in\u201d to identify those who may be struggling.\n\nAmbulance Victoria\u2019s Peer Support Dog Program, which allows staff to bring in accredited dogs to create social interactions and conversations, is a good example of how \u201creaching in\u201d helps with first responder well-being. This kind of approach empowers people through social connections and the appreciation they are also supporting others.\n\nWhile employers need to do more in to facilitate \u201creach in\u201d programs, anyone can create informal support networks. Whether friendship groups, community groups, sporting groups, or something else, the underlying thread should be a committment to each other\u2019s well-being.\n\nRead more: The rise of 'eco-anxiety': climate change affects our mental health, too\n\nAs we continue to contend with this crisis, ensuring firefighters feel supported can make a difference to their well-being. If you see a responder in the street, say thank you. If you see one in a cafe, shout them a cuppa. If you have kids, get them to write a letter or draw a picture and drop it off to the local emergency services station. \n\nWe can\u2019t eliminate the risk firefighters will suffer with mental health problems after what they\u2019ve been through, but these little acts of kindness can make a difference.\n\nIf this article has raised issues for you, or if you\u2019re concerned about someone you
