Their action violates a lot of public interests.\"\n\nLai initially volunteered his services to police to persuade the man not to jump, but police rejected these. Following this, Lai broke through a police barrier to push the man.\n\nThe pushed man, Chen Fuchao, survived with spinal and elbow injuries, because he landed on a partially-inflated air cushion 8 metres (26 feet) below. Lai was taken away by police.\n\nThe man threatening to jump was in 2,000,000 yuan (U.S.$293,000) of debt.\n\nAt least 12 people have threatened to jump off the bridge since the start of April, causing \"traffic \u2026 to become worse\" according to a spokesman for the Guangzhou public security bureau.\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"mentions": [{"startOffset": 55, "endOffset": 62}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q10737"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 68, "endOffset": 81}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q5639803"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 85, "endOffset": 101}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q16572"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 130, "endOffset": 143}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E106"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 150, "endOffset": 161}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q851422"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 273, "endOffset": 276}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E106"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 398, "endOffset": 401}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E106"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 467, "endOffset": 478}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E107"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 494, "endOffset": 500}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q3997975"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 505, "endOffset": 519}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q3752478"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 601, "endOffset": 604}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E106"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 683, "endOffset": 687}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q846570"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 860, "endOffset": 869}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q16572"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 870, "endOffset": 892}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q906722"}]}}, "documentMetadata": {"title": ["Suicidal man pushed off Chinese bridge"], "language": ["en"], "direction": ["ltr"], "published_date": ["2009-05-23"], "accessed_date": ["2020-08-05T14:10:51.479082"], "url": ["https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Suicidal_man_pushed_off_Chinese_bridge"], "domain": ["https://en.wikinews.org"], "wikinews_categories": ["https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Archived", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Asia", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:China", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Crime_and_law", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Guangdong", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Guangzhou", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:May_23,_2009", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Mental_health", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Published", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Suicide", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Wackynews"], "uuid": ["e87b4c225b953b0d984946bafd7fed3f"], "license": ["//creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/"], "annotators": ["ANN_0", "ANN_1"], "adjudicators": ["ADJ_0", "ADJ_1"]}}
