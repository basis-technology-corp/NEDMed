Or when a male coworker gives her body a fleeting once-over before looking her in the eye?\n\nThese examples may seem relatively innocent to some, but our research has found they can have negative consequences for women\u2019s emotional well-being.\n\nWe asked women to record any incidents of sexual objectification on a smartphone app, alongside rating their feelings several times each day for a week. \n\nWhen women experienced sexual objectification, in many cases it led them to scrutinise their physical appearance, which negatively impacted their emotional well-being. \n\nRead more: Hey, sexy: objectifying catcalls occur more frequently than you might think\n\n## A cycle of objectification\n\nThe process by which sexual objectification is psychologically harmful to women was first described by psychologists Barbara Fredrickson and Tomi-Ann Roberts in the mid-1990s.\n\nAccording to this theory, when women are treated as objects, they momentarily view their own bodies from the perspective of the person objectifying them. In turn, they become preoccupied with their physical appearance and sexual value to others.\n\nThis process of \u201cself-objectification\u201d leads women to experience unpleasant feelings such as shame and anxiety. If repeated, it can eventually lead to long-term psychological harm.\n\nDespite hundreds of studies on the psychology of sexual objectification, convincing evidence of the process described by Fredrickson and Roberts has been lacking until now.\n\nRead more: Explainer: what does the 'male gaze' mean, and what about a female gaze?\n\nWe believe our research, conducted with colleagues in the United States, is the first to demonstrate that when women are exposed to sexually objectifying events in their everyday lives, they become more preoccupied with their physical appearance. \n\nThis, in turn, leads to increased negative emotions like anxiety, anger, embarrassment and shame.\n\n## Our research\n\nWe asked 268 women aged 18 to 46 in Melbourne and St Louis (in the US) to install an app on their smartphones.\n\nSeveral times each day, the app prompted them to rate their emotions, how preoccupied they were with their physical appearance (a measure of self-objectification), and whether they had recently been targeted by sexually objectifying behaviour \u2013 or had witnessed such treatment of other women.\n\nUsing smartphones to track women\u2019s everyday experiences of sexual objectification has several advantages over other approaches used in most previous objectification research.\n\nWe asked women to document any incidents of sexual objectification in a smartphone app over a week. From shutterstock.com\n\nFirst, we can be sure we captured \u201creal world\u201d examples of sexual objectification rather than artificial scenarios that may not represent life outside the lab.\n\nSecond, instead of relying on potentially unreliable memories of past events and feelings recorded in surveys or journals, by using frequent smartphone surveys we could gather more accurate \u201creal time\u201d reports of sexual objectification.\n\nFinally, repeatedly sampling women\u2019s daily experiences enabled us to observe the psychological processes triggered by sexual objectification.\n\nRead more: Rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment: what\u2019s the difference?\n\n## What we found\n\nMore than 65% of women in our study were personally targeted by sexually objectifying behaviour at least once during the monitoring period. This might have included being ogled, catcalled or whistled at.\n\nOur findings were consistent with Fredrickson and Roberts\u2019s theory: women reported being preoccupied with their physical appearance roughly 40% more when they had recently been targeted by sexually objectifying behaviours, compared to when they had not.\n\nImportantly, these momentary spikes in self-objectification predicted subsequent increases in women\u2019s negative emotions, particularly feelings of shame and embarrassment.\n\nAlthough these increases were small, they were reliable, and appear to be indirectly caused by exposure to sexually objectifying behaviours.\n\nWomen in our study were affected by witnessing incidents of sexual harassment, as well as experiencing it them themselves. From shutterstock.com\n\nWomen may think about their appearance independent of experiencing sexual objectification. Interestingly, we found when women self-objectified, they sometimes reported feeling slightly happier and more confident.\n\nSo when women think about themselves in an objectified manner, they can feel both positive and negative emotions. But self-objectification that arises as a result of being objectified by someone else appears to have an exclusively negative impact on emotions.\n\nRead more: Women can build positive body image by controlling what they view on social media\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that in our results, experiencing sexual objectification on its own didn\u2019t directly lead to increases in women\u2019s negative feelings. Rather, the harmful effects of sexual objectification occurred when it resulted in women objectifying themselves.\n\n## Seeing other women objectified\n\nOur participants reported witnessing the objectification of other women on average four times during the week-long study period.\n\nWitnessing the objectification of other women was also followed by reliable (albeit weaker) increases in self-objectification, with similar negative downstream consequences for emotional well-being.\n\nJust as passive smoking is harmful to non-smokers, second-hand exposure to sexual objectification may reduce the emotional well-being of women, even if they are rarely or never objectified themselves.\n\nRead more: Universities unveil plan to reduce sexual harassment and sexual assault on campus\n\nOverall, our study confirms previous research showing sexual objectification of women remains relatively common.\n\nBut importantly, we\u2019ve shown these everyday objectifying experiences are not as innocuous as they may seem. Though subtle, the indirect emotional effects of objectifying treatment may accumulate over time into more serious psychological harm for women.\n\nThis article is a co-publication with Pursuit.\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"mentions": [{"startOffset": 882, "endOffset": 901}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q4858897"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 906, "endOffset": 922}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E103"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1292, "endOffset": 1299}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q154430"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1492, "endOffset": 1503}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q4858897"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1508, "endOffset": 1515}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E103"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1688, "endOffset": 1701}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q30"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1936, "endOffset": 1943}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q154430"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2031, "endOffset": 2040}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q949779"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2045, "endOffset": 2053}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q38022"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2062, "endOffset": 2064}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q30"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3578, "endOffset": 3589}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q4858897"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3594, "endOffset": 3601}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E103"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 6165, "endOffset": 6172}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "E104"}]}}, "documentMetadata": {"title": ["Sexually objectifying women leads women to objectify themselves, and harms emotional well-being"], "language": ["en"], "direction": ["ltr"], "published_date": ["2019-03-13T04:00:00.000Z"], "accessed_date": ["2020-08-10T16:22:43"], "url": ["https://theconversation.com/sexually-objectifying-women-leads-women-to-objectify-themselves-and-harms-emotional-well-being-120762"], "domain": ["theconversation.com"], "conversation_tags": ["https://theconversation.com/topics/sexual-harassment-1992", "https://theconversation.com/topics/sexual-objectification-74021", "https://theconversation.com/topics/mental-health-343", "https://theconversation.com/topics/women-658", "https://theconversation.com/topics/smartphones-1957", "https://theconversation.com/topics/emotional-well-being-74028"], "author": [null], "lead_image_url": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/285219/original/file-20190723-11339-16awu2v.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C176%2C3460%2C1727&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "word_count": ["890"], "uuid": ["77c20407cd11399b997aa891a7ff71b0"], "license": ["https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/"], "annotators": ["ANN_1", "ANN_2"], "adjudicators": ["ADJ_2", "ADJ_0"]}}
