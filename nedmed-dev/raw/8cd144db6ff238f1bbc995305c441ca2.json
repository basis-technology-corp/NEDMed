{"version": "1.1.0", "data": "During the last few weeks, hundreds of families have been separated, following the Trump administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy towards illegal immigrants. Even though the separations have reportedly stopped, it is not clear when the families will be unified. There are also reports of children being possibly put in foster homes and at least one teenager missing, after walking out of a shelter.\n\nThis is not the first time that children have been separated. Exclusion and separation has impacted African-Americans during slavery, Native Americans during the Trail of Tears, and Japanese-Americans during internment, to name a few.\n\nAs a scholar who is actively engaged in child protection research and who examines the unnecessary removals of children from their parents, I am all too aware that the repercussions of such policies often take a lifetime to undo. \n\n## History of separating families\n\nDuring the years of slavery, there was daily buying and selling of children from their enslaved parents. No legal restraints existed on slave owners, who chose to dispose of their property as they saw fit. \n\nAnother period of state-sanctioned separations was in the 1800s, after President Andrew Jackson authorized the Indian Removal Act. Native Americans, mostly youth, were forcibly taken out of their homes and communities and asked to walk for miles to a specially designated \u201cIndian territory.\u201d Thousands died on that journey. It has since been named the \u201cTrail of Tears.\u201d\n\nThe government, nonetheless went ahead with its policies and mandated that Native American children be educated apart from their families in boarding schools. This was a method of creating a distance between children and their Native American parents so that they would slowly let go of their native values \u2013 what scholars today describe as forced assimilation.\n\nThis practice went on until the passing of the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 when Native American parents were given the legal right to refuse boarding school education. \n\nThe internment of Japanese-Americans was also a time of enactment of exclusionary policies by the American government. President Roosevelt ordered that Japanese, many of them United States citizens, be forcibly removed and held in camps. Children, even infants, were placed in these camps with their parents, and sometimes without. \n\nAs is being done today, these separations were staunchly defended and rationalized, without much consideration of the negative and long-lasting trauma. \n\n## The long-term impact\n\nRecent research on the impact of family separation during slavery focuses on the trauma that has been passed down over the years. \n\nScholar Joy DeGruy, in her seminal book \u201cPost Traumatic Slave Syndrome,\u201d describes the impact of that history on black families today. \n\nIt is \u201ccommon sense,\u201d adds DeGruy, who has spent many years researching the multigenerational trauma, that hundreds of people who endured slavery would continue to pass on behaviors, such as anger, violence and shame, down to contemporary generations. \n\nScholars have also researched the impact of American Indian boarding schools. Their findings included reports of abuse in boarding school and how that manifested in their later years. As children, they were found to have high levels of depression. Research has also linked the adverse childhood experience of boarding school with difficulty in managing stress as adults. \n\nWithin the foster care system, scholars have long researched the harm in multiple placements, meaning moving children from one foster care placement to another. Children who experience such unstable placement experience, after being separated from their families, suffer from profound distress and a loss of belonging. \n\nThe trauma of separation leaves deep physical and psychological impact that carries into adulthood. This essentially means the healthy development of a child is disrupted in many ways. \n\n## Separation of families in 2018\n\nChildren form a line, as undocumented immigrant families are released from detention in Texas. Loren Elliott/Reuters\n\nThe consequences of adverse childhood experiences can be minimized if a child is in a loving and nurturing environment where they feel safe and are able to acquire appropriate ways to cope. \n\nThese past comparisons bring us to what is occurring today. President Trump\u2019s executive order has stopped any additional separations, but it does not undo the damage that has already been set in motion.\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"mentions": [{"startOffset": 83, "endOffset": 88}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q22686"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 500, "endOffset": 517}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49085"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 534, "endOffset": 550}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 582, "endOffset": 600}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q1156766"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1182, "endOffset": 1191}], "type": "TITLE", "entityId": "Q30461"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1192, "endOffset": 1206}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q11817"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1222, "endOffset": 1228}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1242, "endOffset": 1258}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1557, "endOffset": 1572}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1709, "endOffset": 1724}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1892, "endOffset": 1898}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1930, "endOffset": 1945}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2038, "endOffset": 2056}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q1156766"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2118, "endOffset": 2137}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q48525"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2139, "endOffset": 2148}], "type": "TITLE", "entityId": "Q30461"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2149, "endOffset": 2158}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q8007"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2172, "endOffset": 2180}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q161652"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2195, "endOffset": 2208}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q30"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2498, "endOffset": 2504}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q193078"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2614, "endOffset": 2620}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q654426"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2665, "endOffset": 2672}], "type": "TITLE", "entityId": "Q2248623"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2673, "endOffset": 2683}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E84"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2706, "endOffset": 2735}], "type": "PRODUCT", "entityId": "Q7233727"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2778, "endOffset": 2783}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49085"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2829, "endOffset": 2835}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E84"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2896, "endOffset": 2902}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q654426"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3100, "endOffset": 3115}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q49297"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3292, "endOffset": 3302}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q4340209"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3409, "endOffset": 3415}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q3500368"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3714, "endOffset": 3722}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q5283089"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3754, "endOffset": 3760}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q654426"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4060, "endOffset": 4065}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q1439"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4067, "endOffset": 4080}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E88"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4081, "endOffset": 4088}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q130879"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4342, "endOffset": 4351}], "type": "TITLE", "entityId": "Q30461"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4352, "endOffset": 4357}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "Q22686"}]}}, "documentMetadata": {"title": ["The long history of separating families in the US and how the trauma\u00a0lingers"], "language": ["en"], "direction": ["ltr"], "published_date": ["2018-03-03T05:00:00.000Z"], "accessed_date": ["2020-08-10T16:29:00"], "url": ["https://theconversation.com/the-long-history-of-separating-families-in-the-us-and-how-the-trauma-lingers-98616"], "domain": ["theconversation.com"], "conversation_tags": ["https://theconversation.com/topics/african-americans-13366", "https://theconversation.com/topics/trump-administration-33294", "https://theconversation.com/topics/slavery-4624", "https://theconversation.com/topics/immigrant-children-55804", "https://theconversation.com/topics/president-andrew-jackson-55790", "https://theconversation.com/topics/mental-health-343", "https://theconversation.com/topics/immigration-411", "https://theconversation.com/topics/native-americans-7853"], "author": ["Jessica Pryce"], "lead_image_url": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/224782/original/file-20180625-19385-set6mn.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "word_count": ["688"], "uuid": ["8cd144db6ff238f1bbc995305c441ca2"], "license": ["https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/"], "annotators": ["ANN_1", "ANN_2"], "adjudicators": ["ADJ_2", "ADJ_0"]}}
