{"version": "1.1.0", "data": "The use of weak electrical currents to stimulate the brain is a safe treatment for depression and might even improve attention and reduce pain elsewhere in the body, an Australian study has found.\n\nMedical researchers from the University of New South Wales and the Black Dog Institute found that up to half of the 64 participants in the study reported substantial improvements after receiving transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) daily for six weeks.\n\nThe treatment passes a mild, painless current into the brain through electrodes on the scalp. Patients remain awake during the procedure. Previous studies have shown that it may boost memory performance, and can also improve brain function in schizophrenia patients.\n\n\u201cWe are excited about these results,\u201d said trial leader, Professor Colleen Loo, from the university\u2019s School of Psychiatry. \u201cThis is the largest randomised controlled trial of transcranial direct current stimulation ever undertaken and, while the results need to be replicated, they confirm previous reports of significant antidepressant effects.\u201d \n\nThe findings of Professor Loo\u2019s team have been published in the British Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nProfessor Loo said that participants in the study had not benefited from at least two other depression treatments. \n\n\u201cMost of the people who went into this trial had tried at least two other antidepressant treatments and got nowhere. So the results are far more significant than they might initially appear - we weren\u2019t dealing with people who were easy to treat,\u201d Professor Loo said.\n\nThe results improved gradually, suggesting the treatment is best applied over an extended period. Participants who improved during the trial were offered weekly follow-up treatments. Of those people, 85% showed no relapse after three months. \n\nThe research team also reported unexpected physical and mental benefits in participants, including improved attention.\n\n\u201cOne participant with a long-standing reading problem said his reading had improved after the trial and others commented that they were able to think more clearly,\u201d Professor Loo said.\n\n\u201cAnother participant with chronic neck pain reported that the pain had disappeared during the trial. We think that is because tDCS actually changes the brain\u2019s perception of pain. We believe these cognitive benefits are another positive aspect of the treatment worthy of investigation.\u201d\n\nThe researchers are now considering an additional trial to include people with bipolar disorder. Early results from overseas suggest tDCS is just as effective in this group.\n\nPaul Fitzgerald, a Professor of Psychiatry at Monash University, cautioned that although research into tDCS had produced some positive results, it was \u201cstill early days\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere have been some positive studies, but not all of them have been positive - there have also been some studies that have failed to show a difference between active treatment and placebos.\n\n\"A lot of the studies that have been conducted to date have been involved a relatively small patient population, and with limited duration of follow-up after the end of treatment. You\u2019d really need to build up a greater series of studies with large patient numbers and longer-term follow ups to really get a handle on how effective this treatment might be.\u201d\n\nProfessor Fitzgerald said that patients who suffered from very severe depression and who did not get better with the \u201cstandard treatment options\u201d were often open to new treatment possibilites, including electrical brain stimulation.\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"mentions": [{"startOffset": 69, "endOffset": 78}], "type": "TREATMENT",
