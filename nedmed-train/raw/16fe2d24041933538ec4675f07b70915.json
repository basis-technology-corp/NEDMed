{"data": "Officials said on Thursday, after analyzing data from the Germanwings Flight 9525 cockpit voice recorder, that the airbus crashed into the French Alps because its co-pilot deliberately crashed it.\n\nOn the cockpit voice recorder, the captain can be heard trying to get back into the cockpit.  Transponder data indicates the autopilot was told to descend form 38,000 feet to 100 feet.  The last part of the recording contains screaming during the sudden decent.\n\nInvestigators are still searching for the plane's flight data recorder.\n\nThe co-pilot started training in 2008, and was diagnosed in 2009 with serious depression according to BBC News. Later he completed his training and passed all his tests to pilot, according to Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr.\n\nIn light of this incident, several airlines announced a ban on leaving any one person alone in the cockpit.\n\nThe flight path and altitude chart can be seen in the images below.\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"entityId": "Q155038", "type": "ORG", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 58, "endOffset": 69, "timestamp": "2020-12-15T07:57:07.162000"}]}, {"entityId": "Q1630884", "type": "LOC", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 139, "endOffset": 150, "timestamp": "2020-12-15T07:57:07.162000"}]}, {"entityId": "T2", "type": "DISEASE", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 612, "endOffset": 622, "timestamp": "2020-11-11T17:08:06.931000"}]}, {"entityId": "T3", "type": "PRODUCT", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 636, "endOffset": 644, "timestamp": "2020-11-11T17:08:06.931000"}]}, {"entityId": "Q9325", "type": "ORG", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 726, "endOffset": 735, "timestamp": "2020-12-15T08:03:12.833000"}]}, {"entityId": "Q484876", "type": "TITLE", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 736, "endOffset": 751, "timestamp": "2020-12-15T08:03:12.833000"}]}, {"entityId": "Q1045681", "type": "PER", "headMentionIndex": 0, "mentions": [{"startOffset": 752, "endOffset": 765, "timestamp": "2020-12-15T08:03:12.833000"}]}]}}, "documentMetadata": {"title": ["Officials say co-pilot intentionally crashed Germanwings Airbus"], "language": ["en"], "direction": ["ltr"], "published_date": ["2015-03-29"], "accessed_date": ["2020-11-06T10:28:32.105354"], "url": ["https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Officials_say_co-pilot_intentionally_crashed_Germanwings_Airbus"], "domain": ["https://en.wikinews.org"], "wikinews_categories": ["https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Archived", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Aviation", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Crime_and_law", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Disasters_and_accidents", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Europe", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:France", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Germanwings", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Germanwings_Flight_9525", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Germany", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Lufthansa", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:March_29,_2015", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Mental_health", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Published", "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Category:Transport"], "license": ["https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/"], "uuid": ["16fe2d24041933538ec4675f07b70915"]}}
