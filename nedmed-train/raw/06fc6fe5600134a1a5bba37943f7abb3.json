Common perception is that men are more occupied with sex than women, but women think about sex 34 times a day, which is every 14th minute. \n\nDating Direct performed a survey on 1,000 women asking, questions about their sexlife. Almost 50% of them are not satisfied, making them think of sex more, especially when they are at work. \n\nHeavy snow in Greece and Turkey\n\nSouthern Greece and large parts of Turkey were hit by heavy snowfall today.
