{"version": "1.1.0", "data": "This is a confusing and, frankly, scary time for a lot of us. There\u2019s so much contradictory information, and the \u201cright\u201d thing to do yesterday is now the \u201cwrong\u201d thing to do today. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling edgy, having trouble sitting still or concentrating, finding yourself constantly or obsessively checking for updates, losing sleep, or waking in the early hours of the morning feeling anxious \u2013 you\u2019re not alone. \n\nThese are completely normal, human reactions to a completely abnormal situation. Worrying about whether you\u2019re doing enough to protect yourself and others, whether you\u2019re going to lose income, and what this will all mean long-term is to be expected. \n\nRead more: Coronavirus is stressful. Here are some ways to cope with the anxiety\n\nYou might be wondering whether this worry and other feelings of anxiety might indicate a developing mental health problem. \n\nFeeling this way for a few days, or even weeks, in the context of a major national emergency, does not indicate that you have a mental disorder. \n\nBut some people will need to access support or talk to their GP about ongoing concerns.\n\n## What\u2019s normal?\n\nNormal fear responses are part of a healthy, adaptive process that allows us to get away from or deal with something we perceive as dangerous. \n\nNormal anxiety: \n\n  * is situation specific \u2013 related to a particular event of circumstance \n  * is limited in time \n  * does not have a long-term impact on your ability to go about your day-to-day life (although there may be short periods where it can feel overwhelming). \n\n\n\nHowever, sometimes our fear can become overwhelming and start to impact on our ability to function in our daily lives. \n\nSome anxiety symptoms to be aware of are excessive worry which is difficult to control, restlessness, feeling easily fatigued, having difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension or sleep disturbance. \n\nSometimes fear can impact on your ability to function. lauren rushing/Flickr, CC BY-NC-ND\n\n## Coping mechanisms while social distancing\n\nIn times of trouble, Australians usually band together to support each other with hugs, a helping hand and a nice hot cuppa. We raise money, have benefit concerts, and get to work so we can feel we\u2019re doing something. We build belonging in our community, and feel a sense of accomplishment when we pull through together.\n\nThis time it\u2019s different, and our normal ways of coping with disasters are not going to work. For many of us, social distancing means we are not able to use most of our day to day coping strategies either, such as going to the gym or hanging out with friends.\n\nRead more: Why are we calling it 'social distancing'? Right now, we need social connections more than ever\n\nBut there are things we can do to buffer against the impact of uncertain and traumatic times. \n\nHaving a strong sense of belonging, along with a regular sense of accomplishment, are key to our mental well-being. They\u2019re linked with lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and higher levels of mental well-being. \n\nBelonging\n\nSocial distancing does not require social isolation. There are safe ways to connect with people that don\u2019t involve putting yourself at risk of COVID-19 exposure. \n\nStaying connected is not just a nice thing to do \u2013 it\u2019s actually important for our health. Some theorists have suggested that belonging is a fundamental human motivation, just as compelling as the need for food. \n\nDon\u2019t wait for people to connect with you \u2013 reach out to them. There\u2019s a good chance that they\u2019re feeling isolated and afraid as well.\n\nRead more: Social distancing can make you lonely. Here's how to stay connected when you're in lockdown\n\nAccomplishment\n\nIt\u2019s important to find ways in your day to day life to feel a regular sense of accomplishment, and it might be a matter of re-framing what you consider to be an accomplishment. \n\nIf you have kids in the background, dogs barking to be taken for a walk, and all the other wonderful interruptions that may come with working from home, it\u2019s likely that just reading and responding to emails is an accomplishment in itself. \n\nEven simple tasks can be seen as accomplishments. Nenad Stojkovic/Flickr, CC BY\n\nIf you\u2019re not working at the moment and funds are tight think about what else you can accomplish. Spring clean. Plant capsicum, strawberry or tomato seeds saved from your lunch and see if they will grow. Or learn something new, like robotics, knitting or crochet.\n\nRead more: 6 strategies to juggle work and young kids at home: it's about flexibility and boundaries\n\n## When to get help?\n\nSometimes what you\u2019re experiencing will signal a more serious problem that needs some external support. \n\nIt\u2019s time to seek help if:\n\n  * symptoms of anxiety are starting to affect your ability to function in your daily life \n  * the symptoms are getting worse \n  * the symptoms feel overwhelming, or \n  * the symptoms persist over time \u2013 more days than not. \n\n\n\nSupports are available where and when you need them. The Lifeline phone line is open 24 hours on 13 11 14. \n\nBeyondblue has online information and resources such as the beyondblue web chat. \n\nFor children, teens and young adults, KidsHelpline has supports available by phone at 1800 55 1800, web chat or email. \n\nYour GP can help you to identify whether your symptoms meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. They can also write a mental health care plan, if appropriate, and refer you to professional services in your local community. \n\nRead more: 'Cabin fever': Australia must prepare for the social and psychological impacts of a coronavirus lockdown\n", "attributes": {"entities": {"type": "list", "itemType": "entities", "items": [{"mentions": [{"startOffset": 678, "endOffset": 689}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q89469904"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 849, "endOffset": 870}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q12135"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1002, "endOffset": 1017}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q12135"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1281, "endOffset": 1288}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q154430"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1574, "endOffset": 1578}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q44619"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1677, "endOffset": 1693}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q154430"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1713, "endOffset": 1728}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q1436482"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1760, "endOffset": 1772}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q21118175"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1782, "endOffset": 1797}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q9690"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1806, "endOffset": 1830}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q154430"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1846, "endOffset": 1860}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q1147377"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1864, "endOffset": 1881}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q1364801"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1895, "endOffset": 1899}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q44619"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1940, "endOffset": 1954}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E63"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 1955, "endOffset": 1961}], "type": "PRODUCT", "entityId": "Q103204"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2043, "endOffset": 2054}], "type": "NAT", "entityId": "Q1318423"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2961, "endOffset": 2971}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q42844"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2976, "endOffset": 2983}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q544006"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 2984, "endOffset": 2992}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 3190, "endOffset": 3198}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q84263196"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4152, "endOffset": 4167}], "type": "PER", "entityId": "E62"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4168, "endOffset": 4174}], "type": "PRODUCT", "entityId": "Q103204"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4710, "endOffset": 4718}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4722, "endOffset": 4729}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q544006"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4806, "endOffset": 4814}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4842, "endOffset": 4850}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4882, "endOffset": 4890}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 4992, "endOffset": 5000}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q6545404"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5044, "endOffset": 5054}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q2900494"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5104, "endOffset": 5114}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q2900494"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5165, "endOffset": 5177}], "type": "ORG", "entityId": "Q6404929"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5294, "endOffset": 5302}], "type": "SYMPTOM", "entityId": "Q169872"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5328, "endOffset": 5344}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q544006"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5487, "endOffset": 5498}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q489412"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5501, "endOffset": 5510}], "type": "LOC", "entityId": "Q408"}, {"mentions": [{"startOffset": 5570, "endOffset": 5581}], "type": "DISEASE", "entityId": "Q89469904"}]}}, "documentMetadata": {"title": ["Can\u2019t sleep and feeling anxious about coronavirus?
